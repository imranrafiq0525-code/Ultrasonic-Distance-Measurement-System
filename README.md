# Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement-System
The Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System uses an ultrasonic sensor to transmit sound waves and calculate the distance to an object based on the time taken for the echo to return. The measured distance is processed by Arduino and displayed on an LCD in real time.
